# proxy-checker

This tool checks the working status of proxy servers continuously with certain time period provided.

[This](https://google.com) url is used loaded using the corresponding proxy to calculate the response time.

Smaller the response value, faster the proxy. 

This code will work on Windows by default. To make this work on Linux OS, edit the last line of code ```os.system('cls')``` to ```os.system('clear')```.

* **Note:** _This is beta version, new user-friendly features will be added later._
